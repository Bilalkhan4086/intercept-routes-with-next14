This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) intercept and parallel routes example project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

I am facing problems while using intercept routes, my route structure is a bit different like in the demo example given in nextjs docs [github expample](https://github.com/vercel-labs/nextgram/tree/main/src/app)
